# Ant-Colony-Algorithm
-An Ant Colony Algorithm GUI program

WHAT DOSE THIS PROJECT DO???

- Create your Own Environment  (There is few of initial Environments which I crated for you to test and play)

- Find the shotest path

- Save result as .jpg and .gif like this:

![image](https://github.com/LiarGs/Ant-Colony-Algorithm-GUI/blob/master/images/Shortest%20Path%20Map%20(with%20dead-cell).jpg)

WHAT FEATURES DOES IT HAVE?

- Clear visual interface

- New "Dead-cell" algorithm which greatly reduces the number of iterations(Of course you can choose not to use it)

- You Can see how ants works on figure

- Reseet srart and end easily

- Adjustable parameters

- Randomize a Grapph of course

- Choose result save path

CAN I USE IT TO SLOVE A MAZE???

- YES!! Design your maze and slove it with ants. You will get a solution

HOW I USE THIS PROJECT???

- Make sure you download all files in the same file

- You can just run Ant GUI.exe without a python
 
- !! parameter.pkl and save_path.pkl must be in the same file with .exe !!

- Set new result save path in 'Settings'

- Click 'Start' to start and Explore yourself

- It is recommended to run '20 Ietration, 100 Ant-numbers' first and run '80 Ietration 100 Ant-numbers' after. It will be better than '100 Ietration, 100 Ant-numbers' at first

WHAT LANGUAGE DOSE THIS PROJET USE??

- Python of course

- Based on Ant Colony Algorithm and My original "Dead-cell" algorithm

CAN IT BE USED FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES???

- NO!!! I desgin it as my Graduation Project and I have not pass it

LAST 
- Randomize a Maze (to do)

- Have FUN!!! and Enjoy it!!
